Websites allow owners to communicate with users and vice versa. 

Owner to user is through text and video. 

User to owner is through a form. A web form is how you purchase items. 

Pain and reward. Your site offers a reward: items for sale, access to information. If the pain of completing the form is less than value of the reward, they will fill it out.

Content:

Layout: 
- Labels always need to be left aligned with the labels placed above the input. 
    - Eyetracking needs to be a straight line, with minimum left and right. 
- Use a single input area for phone numbers. 
    - Numbers are different from all over the world. 
- Multiple Steps
    - Break your form into multiple pages.
